<h2>The Goal:</h2>

Create a weather forecasting app what shows the current weather in a specific city entered by the user as well as a 5-day forecast.
The entries are logged into the localStorage and showed in a list. Each element has to be clickable so that, when clicked, the page updates with the new city data.

<h2>The Process:</h2>

First I started by breaking down the functionality of the app, so I can understand what variables to declare, what functions to create and what conditions to write.
The app uses 2 weather APIs to fetch data depending on the user input. One for live weather and the other for a 5-day forecast
The cities are included in an array, saved on the localStorage then showed in a list.
